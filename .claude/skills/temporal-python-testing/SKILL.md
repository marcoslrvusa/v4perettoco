# Temporal Python Testing Strategies

Comprehensive testing approaches for Temporal workflows using pytest, progressive disclosure resources for specific testing scenarios.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Unit testing workflows** - Fast tests with time-skipping
- **Integration testing** - Workflows with mocked activities
- **Replay testing** - Validate determinism against production histories
- **Local development** - Set up Temporal server and pytest
- **CI/CD integration** - Automated testing pipelines
- **Coverage strategies** - Achieve ≥80% test coverage

## Testing Philosophy

**Recommended Approach** (Source: docs.temporal.io/develop/python/testing-suite):

- Write majority as integration tests
- Use pytest with async fixtures
- Time-skipping enables fast feedback (month-long workflows → seconds)
- Mock activities to isolate workflow logic
- Validate determinism with replay testing

**Three Test Types**:

1. **Unit**: Workflows with time-skipping, activities with ActivityEnvironment
2. **Integration**: Workers with mocked activities
3. **End-to-end**: Full Temporal server with real activities (use sparingly)

## Quick Start Guide

### Basic Workflow Test

```python
import pytest
from temporalio.testing import WorkflowEnvironment
from temporalio.worker import Worker

@pytest.fixture
async def workflow_env():
    env = await WorkflowEnvironment.start_time_skipping()
    yield env
    await env.shutdown()

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_workflow(workflow_env):
    async with Worker(
        workflow_env.client,
        task_queue="test-queue",
        workflows=[YourWorkflow],
        activities=[your_activity],
    ):
        result = await workflow_env.client.execute_workflow(
            YourWorkflow.run,
            args,
            id="test-wf-id",
            task_queue="test-queue",
        )
        assert result == expected
```

### Basic Activity Test

```python
from temporalio.testing import ActivityEnvironment

async def test_activity():
    env = ActivityEnvironment()
    result = await env.run(your_activity, "test-input")
    assert result == expected_output
```

## Coverage Targets

**Recommended Coverage** (Source: docs.temporal.io best practices):

- **Workflows**: ≥80% logic coverage
- **Activities**: ≥80% logic coverage
- **Integration**: Critical paths with mocked activities
- **Replay**: All workflow versions before deployment

## Key Testing Principles

1. **Time-Skipping** - Month-long workflows test in seconds
2. **Mock Activities** - Isolate workflow logic from external dependencies
3. **Replay Testing** - Validate determinism before deployment
4. **High Coverage** - ≥80% target for production workflows
5. **Fast Feedback** - Unit tests run in milliseconds
